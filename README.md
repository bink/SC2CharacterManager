# SC2 Character Manager
This is a character management tool for creating and managing characters in the StarCraft 2 Pen & Paper RPG by Leovaunt Game Design!
The rules for the game can be found at http://www.leovauntgamedesign.com/
You can test the tool itself at https://bink.github.io/SC2CharacterManager/index.html
## Current state of development
The editor currently supports creating, saving and loading characters, choosing their race (currently only Terran) and background and adjusting their attributes and skills. It automatically adjusts statistics like hit points accordingly.
Specializations and talents are planned as well as more races and a tab to roll dice and automatically add bonuses.
